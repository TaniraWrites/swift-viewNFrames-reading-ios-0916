## Outline / Notes

I **LOVE** this explanation regarding Frames & Bounds. It was a stackoverflow answer.

[Apple doc](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/Coordinates/Coordinates.html) on view geometry

I like the approach the Stack Overflow answer gives. I think we could simplify it even more. Maybe even include a project that allows them to mess with the controls to see how stuff moves
